1 Occupation codes are based on the Standard Occupational Classification 2018. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2 STEM workers are those employed in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics occupations. To enhance comparability of data across statistical agencies and organizations studying the STEM workforce, the Standard Occupational Classification Policy Committee, consisting of representatives from 9 federal agencies, convened at the request of the Office of Management and Budget  to create guidelines for the classification of STEM workers. The final recommendations are available online at www.bls.gov/soc/#crosswalks. Based on this classification, STEM includes computer and mathematical occupations, engineers, engineering technicians, life scientists, physical scientists, social scientists, science technicians, and  STEM managers",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3 Data are based on a sample and are subject to sampling variability. A margin of error is a measure of an estimate's variability. The larger the margin of error in relation to the size of the estimates, the less reliable the estimate. When added to and subtracted from the estimate, the margin of error forms the 90 percent confidence interval. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All estimates have been reviewed to ensure that no confidential information is disclosed (Disclosure Review Board# CBDRB-FY21-POP001-0010).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Estimates may not add to the total due to rounding. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
